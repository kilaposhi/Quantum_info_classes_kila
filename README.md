# Quantum Computing classes : Practical âš› 
  
---
In this repository you can find the jupyter notebooks I did for my university class about quantum computing.  
This class was a formal introduction to quantum computing. During the practical classes we learned how to use Jupyter notebook and qiskit. I implemented some famous quantum algorithm (Simon algorithm, Grover search...) and I wrote a rapport / commentary, it's all in french though.
